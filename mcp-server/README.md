# bsp-mcp

MCP server for any [BSP-compliant](https://behavioralstate.io) endpoint. Exposes the BSP command and query surface as MCP tools so any LLM client (ChatGPT Desktop, Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot, Cursor) can discover and interact with a BSP service.

Supports **multiple named connections** in a single server instance — useful for admins who need to operate across tenant-scoped and platform-level surfaces, or across entirely separate BSP applications.

## Start with AI

Paste either prompt into your LLM client to get configured in under a minute.

**Configure bsp-mcp** — generates the exact env vars and `mcpServers` JSON for your client:

```
Configure bsp-mcp so I can use my BSP service from [VS Code Copilot / Claude Desktop / Cursor].

Service base URL: [https://api.example.com/bsp]
API key: [my-api-key]
Tenant ID: [my-tenant-id]  ← remove this line if not multi-tenant

Output the exact env vars and mcpServers JSON block to add to my client config.

```

**Make your service BSP-compliant** — scaffolds the four required endpoints in your framework:

```
Make my [ASP.NET Core / Express / FastAPI / Spring Boot] service BSP-compliant.

I need these four endpoints:
- GET /.well-known/bsp — discovery manifest
- GET /commands — catalogue listing accepted commands with JSON Schema
- POST /commands — CloudEvents 1.0 entry point
- GET /queries — query catalogue

Auth: X-Api-Key header. Set authentication.type = "apikey" in the manifest.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_connections` | List all configured connections with names, endpoints, and descriptions *(only shown when multiple connections are configured)* |
| `get_command_catalogue` | List all commands this endpoint accepts |
| `get_command_schema` | Fetch the full JSON Schema for a command type — learn the exact fields required |
| `send_command` | Send a command (CloudEvent 1.0 envelope built automatically) |
| `send_command_and_wait` | Send a command then poll a query until a condition is met |
| `get_query_catalogue` | List all read queries this endpoint exposes |
| `get_query_schema` | Fetch the JSON Schema for a query — learn parameters and response shape |
| `execute_query` | Execute a query and return current state synchronously |
| `get_workflows` | List the service's published "descriptive sequence" recipes — an optional vendor extension; returns a note if the service publishes none |

Intended LLM flow: `get_command_catalogue` → pick a command → `get_command_schema` → gather fields → `send_command`.
Optionally call `get_workflows` first to see if the service publishes a ready-made recipe for a multi-step process.

When multiple connections are configured all operation tools gain an optional `connection` parameter. If the LLM is not certain which connection the user intends, it calls `list_connections` and asks the user to confirm before proceeding.

## Setup

### 1. Install and build

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Configure

There are three configuration modes. Use whichever fits your setup — they are mutually exclusive and checked in the order listed.

---

### Mode 1 — Per-app env vars *(recommended)*

One set of `BSP_<APP>_*` variables per application. The app name is a single uppercase word (letters and digits, no underscores), e.g. `TRADING`, `HR`, `ACCOUNTING`.

#### Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `BSP_<APP>_BASE_URL` | Root URL of the BSP HTTP surface |
| `BSP_<APP>_API_KEY` | Credential — not required when `AUTH_TYPE=none` |

#### Optional

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BSP_<APP>_TENANT_ID` | — | When set, **auto-generates two connections**: `<app>/tenant` (tenant-scoped) and `<app>/platform` (platform-level). When omitted, generates one connection: `<app>`. |
| `BSP_<APP>_AUTH_TYPE` | `apikey` | How the credential is sent — see [Auth types](#auth-types) below. **Defaults to `apikey` in Mode 1** (unlike Modes 2 and 3 which default to `bearer`). |
| `BSP_<APP>_AUTH_HEADER` | `X-Api-Key` | Header name — only used when `AUTH_TYPE=apikey` and `AUTH_IN=header` |
| `BSP_<APP>_AUTH_IN` | `header` | Where the key is sent when `AUTH_TYPE=apikey`: `header` or `query` |
| `BSP_<APP>_AUTH_PARAM` | `apikey` | Query parameter name — only used when `AUTH_IN=query` |

#### Auth types

> **Default differs by mode.** Mode 1 defaults to `apikey` because BSP services typically use API key headers. Modes 2 and 3 default to `bearer` for backward compatibility.

| `AUTH_TYPE` | What it does | Extra vars needed |
|---|---|---|
| `apikey` *(Mode 1 default)* | Sends the key in a custom header or query param | `AUTH_HEADER` (header name, default `X-Api-Key`) or `AUTH_IN=query` + `AUTH_PARAM` |
| `bearer` *(Modes 2 & 3 default)* | Sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | none |
| `none` | No credentials sent (public endpoint) | `API_KEY` not required |

#### Examples

**Single app, tenant + platform surfaces (most common admin setup):**

```
BSP_TRADING_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/bsp
BSP_TRADING_API_KEY=your-api-key
BSP_TRADING_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
BSP_TRADING_AUTH_TYPE=apikey
```

This generates two connections automatically:
- `trading/tenant` → `https://api.example.com/bsp/tenants/your-tenant-id`
- `trading/platform` → `https://api.example.com/bsp`

**Two separate apps:**

```
BSP_TRADING_BASE_URL=https://trading.example.com/bsp
BSP_TRADING_API_KEY=trading-key
BSP_TRADING_TENANT_ID=tenant-abc
BSP_TRADING_AUTH_TYPE=apikey

BSP_HR_BASE_URL=https://hr.example.com/bsp
BSP_HR_API_KEY=hr-key
BSP_HR_TENANT_ID=tenant-abc
BSP_HR_AUTH_TYPE=apikey
```

This generates four connections: `trading/tenant`, `trading/platform`, `hr/tenant`, `hr/platform`.

**App with no tenant scope:**

```
BSP_MYAPP_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/bsp
BSP_MYAPP_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Generates one connection: `myapp`.

#### MCP client config (stdio)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bsp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["bsp-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "BSP_TRADING_BASE_URL": "https://api.example.com/bsp",
        "BSP_TRADING_API_KEY": "your-api-key",
        "BSP_TRADING_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant-id",
        "BSP_TRADING_AUTH_TYPE": "apikey"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

### Mode 2 — `BSP_CONNECTIONS` JSON array

For advanced scenarios where per-app vars are not flexible enough. Set `BSP_CONNECTIONS` to a JSON array of connection objects — each connection is fully explicit with no auto-generation.

Each object:

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | — | Connection identifier used in the `connection` tool parameter |
| `endpoint` | yes | — | Fully-resolved base URL (no `{tenantId}` placeholder) |
| `apiKey` | yes* | — | Credential (*not required when `authType` is `none`) |
| `authType` | no | `bearer` | `bearer` · `apikey` · `none` |
| `authHeader` | no | `X-Api-Key` | Header name when `authType=apikey` and `authIn=header` |
| `authIn` | no | `header` | `header` or `query` |
| `authParam` | no | `apikey` | Query param name when `authIn=query` |
| `description` | no | — | Human-readable description surfaced to the LLM for connection selection |

---

### Mode 3 — Legacy single connection

For simple single-endpoint setups. Use the flat `BSP_*` variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BSP_ENDPOINT` | yes | — | Base URL of the BSP HTTP surface |
| `BSP_API_KEY` | yes* | — | Credential (*not required when `BSP_AUTH_TYPE=none`) |
| `BSP_AUTH_TYPE` | no | `bearer` | `bearer` · `apikey` · `none` |
| `BSP_AUTH_HEADER` | no | `X-Api-Key` | Header name when `AUTH_TYPE=apikey` |
| `BSP_AUTH_IN` | no | `header` | `header` or `query` |
| `BSP_AUTH_PARAM` | no | `apikey` | Query param name when `AUTH_IN=query` |

---

## Transport options

### stdio — VS Code Copilot, Cursor, Claude Desktop

`MCP_TRANSPORT` defaults to `stdio`. Add to your client's MCP config (see [Mode 1](#mode-1--per-app-env-vars-recommended) example above).

### HTTP — ChatGPT Desktop

Start in HTTP mode and expose via a tunnel:

```bash
MCP_TRANSPORT=http MCP_HTTP_PORT=3001 \
  BSP_TRADING_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/bsp \
  BSP_TRADING_API_KEY=<key> \
  BSP_TRADING_AUTH_TYPE=apikey \
  node dist/index.js

ngrok http 3001
```

Then in ChatGPT Desktop: **Settings → Apps & Connectors → Create**, connector URL: `https://<subdomain>.ngrok.app/mcp`

### HTTP — per-request credential overrides (multi-user backends)

A backend that calls bsp-mcp on behalf of many different logged-in users (e.g. a chat assistant) can't bake one fixed API key into the server's environment — it needs to supply the *current* caller's credentials on every request. When `MCP_TRANSPORT=http`, two optional request headers override the resolved connection for that single call only:

| Header | Effect |
|---|---|
| `X-Api-Key` | Replaces the connection's configured `apiKey` for this request. |
| `X-Tenant-Id` | Replaces the tenant segment of the endpoint for this request. Only applies to a Mode 1 `<app>/tenant` connection (the one generated from `BSP_<APP>_TENANT_ID`) — ignored on connections with no tenant template. Must match `^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$`; an invalid value is ignored (and logged) rather than spliced into the URL. |

Neither header is required — omit both and a request behaves exactly as configured via environment variables. This has no effect on stdio (there's no per-request boundary to attach headers to).

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: <the current user's api key>" \
  -H "X-Tenant-Id: <the current user's tenant>" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"execute_query","arguments":{"connection":"trading/tenant","schema":"list-brokers","params":{}}}}'
```

## CloudEvent `source` field

When sending a command, `send_command` requires a `source` value. The required value is documented in the schema `description` returned by `get_command_schema` — always read it from there, never invent it.

---

## Publishing to npm

Never run `npm publish` directly — the release is fully automated via CI:

```bash
git tag -a mcp/v<x.y.z> -m "Release mcp/v<x.y.z>"
git push origin mcp/v<x.y.z>
```
